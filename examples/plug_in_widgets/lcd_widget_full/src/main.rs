// -------------------------------
// Rust SageBox LCD Widget Example
// -------------------------------
//
// This program demonstrates a simple top-level emulation of an LCD display using plug-in Sagebox widgets 
// that anyone can write for Sagebox
// 
// The code is small in length, showing shows how to include and use a widget with a single line. 
// 
// While currently high-level, the emulation can be expanded to simulate lower-level functions
// such as LCD segments and output ports, and eventually interface directly with
// embedded hardware.
//
// ----------------------------------------------
// Using the Program - Fast Mode vs. default Mode
// ----------------------------------------------
//
// This program has two buttons that each count from 0 to 1,000,000, demonstrating different performance techniques in SageBox.
//
// Default Mode Button:
//
// Counts with continuous LCD updates. Shows basic usage such as updating button titles and handling input through signals.
//
// Fast Mode Button:
//
// Uses FastMode() to limit updates to every 10â€“20ms, greatly increasing performance by avoiding redundant redraws.
// Internally, UpdateReady() checks when to update, and LastUpdate() handles any final display output.
//
// The loop remains simple, while the LCD function handles efficient timing behind the scenes.
//
// --------------------
// About the LCD Widget
// --------------------
//
// The LCD Widget is a simple example of an emulated interface to an LCD. 
//
// As an example of an embedded display widget, it can
//
//  - Display an LCD modeled after an exising, specific hardware LCD 
//	- Take simple numbers to display to the LCD screenwidget
//  - Choose between to modes:  a regular LCD mode, and a Blue Led Mode
//
// A more extensive LCD widget in a real-world scenario would be able to work with different modes from lower-higher levels,
// for an emulation at all levels:
//
//  - Base mode to send simple numbers (the mode supported by this example)
//  - Lower-level modes to support setting individual LCD segments for each number
//  - Allow selection of exterior LCD digit modes, such as the '.' and other lcd points 
//  - Even low-level modes to support the actual hardware interface, talking in I2C or some other format to talk to the hardware directly.
//
