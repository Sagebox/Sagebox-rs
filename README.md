# A High-Performance, Procedural GUI Designed for Rapid, Creative Development

Sagebox is a set of GUI tools that let you add windows, controls, and graphical output to your Rust programs using linear, procedural code ‚Äî without any boilerplate, or the overhead of an event-driven framework. 

Built from scratch, Sagebox was designed as a comprehensive GUI to support everything from cross-platform, high-performance applications, fun-with-graphics programs, down to very simple console-mode-only applications using GUI controls for development or release.

Sagebox drops cleanly into existing code or new projects when rapidly prototyping or exploring creative ideas.

Sagebox is also designed for education, hobbyist, and general creative, free-form development and rapid prototyping without the need to write a lot of interface code just to add a button, slider, or other control -- or to remove them.

> Although this page focuses on procedural examples, Sagebox fully supports event-driven programming for applications built around (or that prefer) that model, and is designed to fully support both models depending on the design of your program.

## Scalable, Easy-to-Use Procedural GUI Tools

Sagebox is a procedural-first GUI toolkit that lets you build console-mode programs or full graphical applications using straightforward, linear code. 



Tools and Controls in Sagebox start simple and can scale as you want to do more.  Additional options for more complexity can be added in as needed through the use of keywords in the function call.

Sagebox manages its own environment, so you don't have to keep track of any of the controls or widgets that are launched, unless you want to.

> Sagebox has been used professionally in the tech industry by companies like Pentair and Pioneer, and most recently in the semiconductor field at ASML, where it was called ‚Äúthat magic program.‚Äù

## Quick Examples (Sagebox in a Nutshell)

If you want some quick controls such as buttons, sliders, or some text widgets, etc., you typically use controls in two lines of code: one line to define the control, and one line to use it.

For example, if you want a slider and a button, all you need are these two lines:


```Rust
let box_slider = Sagebox::dev_slider("box size");
let my_button = Sagebox::dev_button("Press me");
```

![output-dev-slider-box-0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466571-6d968e7b-3e87-4cfa-8060-602137041084.png)

The above code uses the Dev Window controls (one of a few ways to create controls in Sagebox), which creates a slider labeled ***"box size"***, with a default range of 0-100 and default value of 100, followed by a button.

Sagebox puts these in a window for you, and will delete them later when the program ends or the window is dismissed.
When you want to use the controls, you can just call <i>**`box_slider.get_pos()`**</i> and <i>**`my_button.pressed()`**</i>.¬† You can also use <i>**`my_slider.moved()`**</i> to determine if the slider has been moved since the last time checked.


For example,

```rust
let box_size = box_slider.get_pos();
if my_button.pressed { println!("Button was pressed!"); }
```

You can set a custom range and default to the slider by using keywords and chaining them together when you create the slider:


```rust
// Create a slider with some keywords.  The _s form denotes scaleability, to keep the simple form simple.

let box_slider = Sagebox::dev_slider_s("Box Size",kw::range((10,500)) + kw::default(150));
```

![output-dev-slider-box-150](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466616-fed9d593-d165-458f-9c55-84ba93524adf.png)


Now the slider has a range of 10-500, and a default of 150, as shown in the image above.  You can also use floating-point sliders.

With other slider functions, the slider can be told to fill a memory value (e.g. <i>`&mut i32`</i> or <i>`&mut f32`</i>) as it is moved, so there‚Äôs no need to call <i>**box_slider.get_pos()**</i>. This can abstract the GUI from routines that use the slider's real-time position without knowing about the slider or GUI.

Sliders, radio buttons, checkboxes, input boxes, list-boxes, text widgets, and other controls are all this easy to use, and can be scaled to more complexity.


With various widgets, you can call up color selectors, date pickers, formatted message boxes, image view & img before/after windows, and so-forth.

This really represents Sagebox in a nutshell -- all examples for Sagebox (even the larger, more comprehensive ones), use the above approach, just with more Sagebox tools and functions.


## Simple and Powerful
![output-cpp-basics-light](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174572814-6cc3092e-d171-420d-b3e7-a9f73d40992c.png)

By adding just a few more lines of code, more tools can be created. 

The above examples show using Sagebox functions as easy library calls, from basic controls (left), to graphics with and without controls (right) &ndash;
all with just simple function calls without event-driven or GUI programming, representing a small amount of the overall code that stays out of the way and doesn't require any programming or GUI environment. 

The middle image, for example, is a one-line function call:

```rust
Sagebox::image_view_before_after(&image1,&image2);
```

where elements can be added to extend its functionality, and the return class can be kept (or discarded) to control and manage the created window.

# Getting Started

### Install with Cargo

```sh
    cargo add sagebox-rs
```

### With `Cargo.toml`

```sh
    [dependencies]
    sagebox = "0.1"
```
### Simple Program Example

```rust
use sagebox::*

fn main{
    let window = Sagebox::new_window();
    window.write("Hello World!");
    window.wait_close();               // Wait for user to close the window
}
```

#### For a more fun version with a 100pt font centered in the window, just use <i>`write_s()`</i> and add a couple keywords:

```rust
    window.write_s("Hello World", kw::font(100) + kw::center());
```

#### Or set the font size within the text:
```rust
    window.write_s("{100}Hello World",kw::center());
```

## Why Sagebox? ‚Äî Fun with Coding and Creative Programming

Like many programmers, I wanted to code creatively while I design. Sagebox was built as a powerful toolset to quickly add (and just as easily remove) graphic controls, widgets, and other elements without the overhead of event-driven or complex GUI boilerplate. 

Sagebox originated as a powerful GUI toolbox from real-world industry work to produce prototypes and finished products rapidly without sacrificing code quality. 

Sagebox scales with your needs to expand into your overall program, or use it as a development tool that can compile out at runtime.

This approach can make programming more enjoyable by enabling more freeform, exploratory or ad-hoc-style coding, allowing you to concentrate more on the code you want to write rather than the interface code just to have a button, slider, color selector, or whatever else is needed.

 
## Designed to stay out of the way of your code

Sagebox can be added to existing Rust code without changing its structure or setup‚Äîand you don‚Äôt need to write a ‚ÄúSagebox program‚Äù to start using it. It works with native Rust types (like `i32`, `f32`, `(i32,i32)`) and integrates cleanly alongside other libraries, including other GUIs.

<br />
<br />

## Using Sagebox in Console Mode

![output-console-mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466676-d8cec449-a241-4402-9b7e-0e354a4d0777.png)

Sagebox can be used for traditional graphics programs with pure graphics and GUI-based controls ‚Äî or pure Console-Mode applications. 

In Console Mode, you can use Sagebox functions to help with the program user-interface, such as simple sliders, buttons, or other controls. You can also bring up entry boxes, quick dialogs, before & after graphics windows, color selectors, or other widgets.

Because these are just simple function calls, you can put them into your existing code without changing your structure or interfering with the rest of your code.

Even if your end-product code doesn‚Äôt use any GUI-based graphic controls, Sagebox can still be useful during development, helping with user input and visualizing program flow while you‚Äôre developing and debugging.

<br />
<br />

# Fun with Graphics

![output-collage-graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466730-86c6f38a-e743-4f97-be99-8d84be64d39f.png)

Sagebox can also be used as a full GUI when you want it ‚Äî with graphics, controls, and built-in support for creating GUI-based applications.

You can place specific controls, create graphic buttons, and use a wide range of drawing and other graphics functions together.

Sagebox is designed to provide a full range of graphics and GUI controls when you want them ‚Äî and stay out of the way when you don‚Äôt.

The image above shows various programs created with Sagebox, from simple visuals to full applications. For most programs, graphics are generated with just a few lines of code, with some coming from more complex, larger-scale applications.

<br />
<br />

# Standalone and 3rd-Party Widgets

![output-collage-widgets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466845-3b17fbe1-85bc-43f8-9f38-6dd1e248f8af.png)

Sagebox is designed to provide tools for developing and integrating 3rd-party plug-in controls and widgets ‚Äî from dials and meters to real-world instruments like LCD panels and oscilloscopes, or any specialized GUI control you want to add to your program.

- Widgets can be launched from programs using Sagebox and can integrate into existing graphical windows.
- Widgets can also be completely standalone and used on their own inside of a console-mode program with just a one function call with no prior use of Sagebox functions.
- Sagebox will automatically create an environment to support the widget, if necessary.

The entire Sagebox library is available to help create and develop the Widget, without forcing the program using it itself. 

Widgets can be used in both procedural and event-driven applications, and do not need to follow the same programming model as the application that uses them.

Shown above: the Color Selector, Dial Widget, LCD Display Widget, and RGB Spline Widget.  

> See the `plug_in_widgets` examples in the Github project examples

### Embedding Widgets into Graphical Windows

![output-emulation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174466885-1ac37379-5cb0-4538-83c5-1cefeab58dea.png)

Widgets can be embedded seamlessly into graphical windows to create larger GUI-based interfaces with minimal code.

The example above shows two widgets working together to emulate and control an Arduino or other hardware interface.

The LCD is drawn over a circuit board image, while the Dial Widget sits on a stucco background to simulate placement on an indoor wall.

When the dial is moved, the LCD reflects its value in real time, and the same value is printed to the lower debug window using color-coded text to highlight values.

The main interface window also uses a custom design with a rounded title bar and integrated graphic, for a more polished appearance than standard OS-provided window and title bar.


# Fast Real-Time 3-D GPU Graphics <i>(short-term roadmap item)</i>

![output-collage-gpu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174467047-dda08078-cf76-4d76-af24-7689271d5a56.png)

Sagebox's design includes a high-performance GPU graphics module for real-time 3-D visualization. The examples above demonstrate 60+ FPS rendering of complex, high-resolution surfaces ‚Äî often exceeding three million polygons per frame ‚Äî with minimal CPU usage.

Planned for release in the the short-term roadmap, with additional tools for building GPU-accelerated applications released in the following months.

# High Performance Computing: Super-Fast AVX, Multi-Threading Functions <i>(short-term roadmap item)</i>

![output-collage-avx-both](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70604831/174681183-a4fd9c49-b98c-4247-8817-537682f5a5fa.png)

Sagebox was originally started as a platform to develop and explore a number of different projects, such as GPU-based projects, neural networking
and so-forth. 

With Sagelight Image Editor and other projects, a lot of multi-threading AVX/SIMD code was written for very fast processing. 

Now that Sagebox is released, these functions will follow shortly, mostly released as open source. 

Some examples are shown above, all multi-threaded AVX/SIMD functionality, such as the Gaussian/Sinc/Kernel Blur shown above, transferred from Sagelight
Image Editor and other source code, with more coming. 

The example to the right shows a still from a real-time, constantly re-generated texture with 1 million polygons that is actually created on the CPU and transferred
to the GPU twice as fast as sending it directly to the GPU due to the AVX it uses¬† -- it's actually a 2D image where it is much faster to process
the polygons, lighting, and reflections on the CPU than it is to have the GPU do it, thanks to AVX.¬† This adds a lot of power to creating quick, easy, and
generic functions with the GPU. 

----
Sagebox includes a number of high-performance, multi-threaded AVX/SIMD functions used for real-time image processing, FFT functions, mathematical or data visualization, etc.

These components are built for maximum throughput and speed when using the traditonal CPU-based image processing functions.


The examples above include:

- A real-time Julia set rendered with AVX at 60fps in 4k,
- AVX-based Gaussian and Sinc blur filters
- CPU-rendered texture with over 1 million polygons
  - The entire image was construction in the CPU before being sent to the GPU
  - This was faster than sending the polyons to the GPU for rendering because of memory-transfer speed
  - The CPU-generated image is indisinguishable from the GPU-generated image, and has better phong-lighting model representation than the default OpenGL phong model.

Sagebox's internal image-processing core includes a set of high-performance, HPC-level, multi-threading functions.

These routines are not yet part of the public API, but many are already complete and designed for future release as general-purpose tools as completely independent functions with no GUI requirements.
The long-term roadmap is that once Sagebox‚Äôs initial release stabilizes, the timing will be based on developer feeback on which functions to release sooner than later.

<br />
<br />


# Event-Driven Architecture for Large-Scale Applications (in final integration)

While not inherently needed for most applications, Sagebox is built on a high-performance, event-driven architecture that includes a full procedural layer that gives direct access to its full capabilities.

This event-driven design means Sagebox has supported fully event-driven programming by its own nature. The included procedural model is a feature that just about any applications can use as a powerful feature stemming from Sagebox's core event-driven design.

Full access to the event-driven framework is currently being integrated into the Rust interface, with emphasis on memory safety, Rust idiomatic usage, and Borrow Checker requirements.
