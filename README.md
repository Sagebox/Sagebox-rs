# Sagebox-rs - A Procedural GUI Designed for Rapid, Creative Development

Sagebox is a set of GUI tools that let you add windows, controls, and graphical output to your Rust programs, all without adding a lot of event-driven or GUI-specific code just to have graphics and controls in your program. 

Sagebox is great for adding simple GUI elements to existing programs, building utilities, or experimenting with visual features. Most controls take just one or two lines: one to create it, one to use it. 

Sagebox is also designed for education, hobbyist, and general creative, free-form development and rapid prototyping without the need to write a lot of interface code just to add a button, slider, or other control -- or to remove them.

## Why Sagebox? — Fun with Coding and Creative Programming

Like many programmers, I prefer to code creatively as I design, and Sagebox was built as a powerful toolset to quickly add (and just as easily remove) controls, widgets, and other elements without the overhead of event-driven boilerplate or complex GUI frameworks.

Sagebox originated from my consulting work, where I needed to produce prototypes and finished products rapidly—sometimes within hours—without sacrificing code quality. It scales with your needs: expand it into your release program, or use it as a development tool that compiles out at runtime.


This approach makes programming more enjoyable by enabling a more freeform, exploratory coding style, where I can concentrate on the code I want to write rather than the interface code just to have a button, slider, color selector, or whatever I need



## The Sagebox Philosophy

Sagebox was written with a philosophy guiding its design approach to keep it simple and scalable.

  <summary>What Drives Sagebox</summary>

  - **Procedural by design** — No event loops, callbacks, or framework ceremonies  
  - **Zero boilerplate** — Add GUI elements with single function calls  
  - **Rapid iteration** — Experiment freely without architectural overhead  
  - **Scales with your needs** — From quick prototypes to production-ready applications  
  - **Developer-first** — Built for how programmers actually think and work
